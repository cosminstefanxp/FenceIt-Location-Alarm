FenceIt-Location-Alarm
======================
FenceIt is an Android application that allows users to define location-based alarms and custom actions that are executed when the alarms are triggered. The application uses alternative methods to GPS positioning and different data processing algorithms in order to preserve both the battery level and the data connection, while being easy to use and attractively designed.

The idea behind FenceIt is really simple:
1. Define some locations by gathering the required data
2. Define an event that triggers an alarm (e.g. when leaving from or arriving at a location)
3. Define what happens when the alarm is triggered (an action)
